* if log files have taken up lot of space then you need to clear(not to delete) them using this command(for this first become super user by giving first command):

sudo su
cat /dev/null > syslog

in the above code I used the syslog for an example, but you can do this for most any of the files in the log folder, such as

auth.log
auth.log.(any number)
user.log
syslog
rpmpkgs
msec.log
messages
auto.log
boot.log

Do not do this to

lastlog
