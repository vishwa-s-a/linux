* various important points when we are installing packages or softwares

* this is concepts of file permissions and how we can remove or give certain permissions to certain users
  - rw- r-- r--
    u   g   o   these are the arguments used for above notation and each refer as user  group  other
  r - read
  w - write
  x - execute
  chmod o+x demo.txt   here we are giving executable permission to demo.txt for other
  chmod u+x demo.txt   here we are giving executable permisssion to demo.txt for user
  chmod g-x demo.txt   here we are removing executable permission to demo.txt for group
* chmod is used for changing the mod of the file, example giving read or write or execute permission, or removing them

* once we have downloaded .deb file for debian/ubuntu then we should go to downloads section in terminal and then give executable permission to this .deb file
  then in terminal run this command
  sudo apt install ./package_name.deb


* if we have downloaded a zip folder for a software or package, then unzip the folder then cd into that folder through terminal and give executable permission to this .sh 
  file and then in terminal run this command
  example:
  ./Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh 
  ./file_name.sh                      (second example)
